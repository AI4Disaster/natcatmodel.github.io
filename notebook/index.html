	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
	<p>Here I write about the things that interest me. It may be my exploration of a cool dataset, an implementation of a certain algorithm, or a
 fancy visualization I made. As of now, I would like to treat this page as a repository of the things that I experiment on, so expect that
 I'll be posting a lot from a wide range of topics!</p>
	<ul class="blogs">
	  {% for post in site.categories.notebook %}
	    <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> Â» <a href="{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.title }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
	  {% endfor %}
	</ul>
