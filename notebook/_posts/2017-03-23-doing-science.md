As I've started pacing through research life, I began reading a lot of seminal works in the field that I'm in. Seminal papers, in this sense, refer to the works that pioneered a certain idea, and greatly advanced the discipline as a whole. For the field of machine learning, to name a few, you have Hinton's paper in backpropagation (1986),  Schmidhuber's work in long short-term memory (1997),  Olshausen's ideas in sparse coding (2004), Vincent's Stacked Denoising Autoencoders (2010), and Gatys' work in neural style transfer (2015).  

What's interesting, is that most of these pioneering ideas got their motivations not only from the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning, but also from "unrelated" fields that seemed to have no obvious connection in computing. Sparse coding was inspired by early experiments in neurobiology, Convolutional Neural Nets demonstrates how humans perceive objects in a gestalt-like manner, the McCulloch-Pitt Neuron approximates how a biological neuron might work, and Generative Adversarial Nets shows how competition enables two actors to improve by one-upmanship  (and we haven't even delved into natural-language processing yet). Of course these are overly-simplified descriptions of their works, but it's fascinating how other fields, however "far" they seem to be, improve one another, and how big ideas were written down because these scientists studied works outside of their own expertise.  

Perhaps it's natural, because if you are to apply AI to different fields, you need to learn what that field is about. But maybe, this is how Science works: you don't lock yourself inside your own discipline, but instead, you go out and learn from other fields as well. Science, then, is a team sport.  

This is especially true even outside the academe, because the problems of today are not solvable by a single field alone. In the case of AI, you have the question of ethics, regulation, and policy, as we are inching closer to the development general-AIs, and face the risks of AI technology falling into the wrong hands.  

So yes, as a note to my fledgling-researcher self, go out of the room and learn from other fields, you'll never know what you'll find.
