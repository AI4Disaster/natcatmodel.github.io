Hi friends! I am Lester James V. Miranda and welcome to my blog.

A bit of background: I finished a degree in Electronics Engineering (minoring
in Philosophy) from Ateneo de Manila University. Right now, I’m taking
graduate studies in Waseda University in Japan.

I fell in love with engineering at a very young age, I wired my first circuit
when I was ten, and built my first database program in Visual Basic when I was
fourteen. I didn’t stop ever since!. 

I built this site because I realized that I have done a lot of projects in
the past (from open source to the ones required in my classes) but I wasn’t
able to document all of them into something that is readable by anyone. I
also want to reach the programming community, for there are lot of things
that I wanted to share, and I hope that by writing about my projects (or
showing my code), I’ll be able to trade knowledge with everyone!

I know that there are still a LOT of things that I have to learn. As of this
moment, I am so interested in machine learning, data science, Raspberry Pi,
and web development! I will be writing more about these (and anything in
between!).
