almost the end of June and the virus is still raging, moreso in an ill-prepared
country like the Philippines. Inasmuch as I'd like to go through the initial
bouts of anxiety, stress, and adjustment to the work-from-home life, alot has

the past (let alone process these feelings). Today, I'd like to talk more about
my recent reflections&mdash; mainly born from my pandemic-induced routine of
