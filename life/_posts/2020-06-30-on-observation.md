The Pandemic has forced most knowledge-workers like me to work from home.  It's
almost the end of June and the virus is still raging, moreso in an ill-prepared
country like the Philippines. Inasmuch as I'd like to go through the initial
bouts of anxiety, stress, and adjustment to the work-from-home life, alot has
already happened in the last three months that those moments felt like years in
the past (let alone process these feelings). Today, I'd like to talk more about
my recent reflections&mdash; mainly born from my pandemic-induced routine of
**doing nothing**, or taking 6 A.M. walks in a nearby garden around our area. 

These reflections will touch on a variety of topics but is rooted in the
central theme of **doing nothing**[^1], and the importance of *observing* and
*attending* in a world where continuous commercialization encroaches our
physical and mental spaces. 

<!--
Like where most reflections are born, parts of this
essay were written during my early-morning walks in a garden tucked away in a
sprawling business district of Mckinley Hill. 

On this part, just write about your path to that garden and describe the area
vividly

Talk about observing, the value of observation, you're not expecting anything,
you just let it be. It seems that when sitting in the garden, I'm not looking
for something, I'm not expecting something

It's also not expecting anything from you
-->

<!--

These reflections are divided into three parts, corresponding to three spaces:
- The space I move around: the physical space, Mckinley Hill, the garden
- The space I move in: my room, remote work
- The space I move myself: programming and open-source

## On physical spaces

<!-- 
It seems that it's hard to find these spaces anymore
Talk about physical spaces, citing the garden as an example.

## On remote work

## On open-source
