Phew! Took me quite some time to finally set-up my GitHub pages. All thanks to this [tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), and I was
able to build this in no time. For the longest time, I've been using Wordpress as my platform. But upon chancing about the control and freedom that
GitHub Pages offers, I quickly jumped into this platform!
