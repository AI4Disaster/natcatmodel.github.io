	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
	<p>I am excited to share some of the projects I created, both from my course requirements and side projects that I am working on. Most of my
	works revolve around machine learning and optimization, so expect a little bit of math in my posts (although I will try to limit them so that everyone can comprehend!).</p>
	<ul class="posts">
	  {% for post in site.categories.projects %}
	    <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> Â» <a href="{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.title }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
	  {% endfor %}
	</ul>
