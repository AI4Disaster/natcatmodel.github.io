    <p style="font-size:75%">I hailed from the Philippines and currently pursuing graduate studies in Waseda University, Japan.
    I do my research in the <a href="http://www.waseda.jp/sem-hflab/nclab/">Furuzuki Neurocomputing Systems Laboratory</a>, where we study various algorithms that imitate nature. In this blog, I write about my interests in anything about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science.</p>
